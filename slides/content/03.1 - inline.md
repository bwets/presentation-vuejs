## Inline 
- Just add inline-template attribute
- Rendered on page load
- Separate the template from the component definition

# DC
The first one is directly in your HTML page by adding a attribute on the component.
Vue will use the inner content as a template.
Permtits to integrate Vue quickly but not recommanded.
As a best practice, prefer defining templates inside the component
